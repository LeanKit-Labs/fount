## 0.2.x

### 0.2.0
 * bug fix - inject and resolve across multiple containers now works correctly
 * improvement - functions that can't be resolved in static or scoped lifecycles immediately will be once all dependencies become available
 * feature - add a way to register function as value without a wrapper
 * NPM modules
 	* don't auto-backfill dependencies from NPM anymore, it's kinda gross
 	* provide ability to grab an "ambient" module from the require cache
